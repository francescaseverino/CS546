        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Coming from a dominican family, I have always valued the love of my family and hard work. I moved to a small town in Bergen County where I learned to become strong-minded and pursue my goals. I am the first child and the first person in my family to receive a higher education. Seeing the struggles of my family, I hope to achieve sucess that they were not able to. I am now a Software Engineering major at Stevens Institute of Technology, graduting in May 2023. I will also continue my studies at Stevens for my Master's in Computer Science. I love to learn different programming languages and challenege my current abilities to better myself.</p>
