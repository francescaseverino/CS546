    <h1>That Time I Fell In Love With Math</h1>
    <main>
        <p>I was in the fourth grade, and I was struggling with reading. I am bilingual and I would find myself always struggling to read in english. Because of this, I was very insecure on my abilites to learn in general. However, in my struggles, I always found comfort in math. It was simple and much easier to understand. I feel in love with its logical complexity.</p>
        <p>The moment I fell in love was when I become the division queen. My fourth grade teacher was teaching the class about division, specifically long division. Many of the students were struggling with the concept, however, I found myself understanding it rather quickly. My teacher asked for a volunteer to show the answer steps, and, for the time, I stood up to show my answer. I did this for all the examples, and I even had the teacher give me hard problems to solve. And I solved them to everyone's amazement.</p>
        <p>Then, my teacher called me a "division queen," and the class cheered calling me the same name. And from that day on, I fell in love with math and the confidence it brought me.</p>
